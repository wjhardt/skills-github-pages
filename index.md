I am a Model Validator at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, working on Stress Testing models. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the largest banks undergo an annual "stress test" to determine whether or not they are holding enough capital to remain stable in case of a severe recession. My work helps to ensure the soundness of the statistical models used to simulate these recession scenarios.

Previously, I graduated with a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in August 2023. My specialty was additive number theory/combinatorics and my advisor was Jordan Ellenberg. Before that, I attended Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. 

While in graduate school, I interned at the financial firms Jane Street and Two Sigma. More recently, I contributed to Epoch AI's benchmark FrontierMath.
